# OpenRouter API Integration Fix

## Problem Description

Three issues were identified with the OpenRouter API integration:

1. The "refresh prices" button always fails
2. The number of available models is lower than what's available on OpenRouter
3. The "refresh models to defaults" button always fails

## Root Cause Analysis

The root problem was identified as a caching issue. In Flask's debug mode with auto-reloader, module imports happen multiple times, creating separate instances of global variables. This caused the `model_prices_cache` to be instantiated multiple times, preventing updates made in one part of the code from being visible in others.

### Diagnosis Steps:
1. Created test script to verify the OpenRouter API connection works correctly
2. Confirmed API could fetch all 324 models with correct pricing information
3. Identified that the cache variable was not being properly shared between imports
4. Observed issue with Flask debug auto-reloader creating multiple variable instances

## Solution Implemented

We designed a singleton cache implementation with disk persistence that ensures:

1. The cache is shared between all imports
2. The cache survives application restarts
3. Updates to the cache are immediately visible to all parts of the application

### Implementation:
1. Created a singleton `ModelPricesCache` class in `price_updater.py`
2. Added disk persistence to maintain state between application restarts
3. Implemented proper API error handling and logging
4. Updated import references in app.py to use the new singleton pattern

## Validation Tests

We validated the fix through multiple tests:

1. **Direct API Test**: Verified we could fetch all 324 models from OpenRouter API
2. **Cache Persistence Test**: Confirmed the cache could be saved to and loaded from disk
3. **Singleton Test**: Verified that multiple imports maintain the same cache state
4. **Full Application Test**: Verified the app loads all 324 models from the cache

## Key Files Modified

- **price_updater.py**: Implemented singleton cache pattern with disk persistence
- **app.py**: Updated import references to use the singleton cache

## Technical Details

### Singleton Pattern
The singleton pattern ensures there's only one instance of the cache throughout the application lifecycle.

```python
def __new__(cls):
    """Ensure singleton pattern"""
    if cls._instance is None:
        cls._instance = super(ModelPricesCache, cls).__new__(cls)
    return cls._instance
```

### Disk Persistence
Disk persistence via pickle ensures the cache survives application restarts.

```python
def _save_cache(self):
    """Save the cache to disk"""
    try:
        with open(self._cache_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(self._data, f)
        logger.info(f"Saved cache to disk with {len(self._data.get('prices', {}))} models")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error saving cache to disk: {e}")
```

## Results

- Successfully loading 324 OpenRouter models with pricing information
- "Refresh prices" button now properly updates the cache
- "Reset to defaults" button now works correctly
- All model information is maintained between application restarts

## Conclusion

The singleton pattern with disk persistence was an effective solution for this issue, ensuring consistent state across Flask's debug auto-reloader environment and providing reliable access to the full OpenRouter API model catalog.
