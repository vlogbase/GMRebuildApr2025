The old footer design took up more vertical space with:
- Links on one row
- Copyright notice on a separate row below
- Extra space due to block display

## New Footer Design

The new footer design is more compact with:
- All links AND copyright notice on the same row
- Flex layout with proper alignment
- Saves vertical space while maintaining legibility
- Responsive design (will wrap on smaller screens)

## Technical Changes Made

1. **CSS Changes:**
   - Changed footer to flex container with `display: flex`
   - Added `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`
   - Added `flex-wrap: wrap` for responsive behavior

2. **Copyright Display:**
   - Removed `display: block` from copyright
   - Added `margin-left: 8px` for spacing
   - Now displays inline with the links

3. **Consistency:**
   - Updated all policy pages to use the same `.footer-legal-links` class
   - Added Cookie Policy link to all footers that were missing it
   - Ensured consistent copyright display across all pages
