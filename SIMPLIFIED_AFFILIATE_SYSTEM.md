# Simplified Affiliate System

## Overview
This document describes the simplified affiliate system we've implemented to streamline the affiliate program and resolve persistent issues with PayPal email updates and CSRF token validation failures.

## Key Changes

### 1. User Model Integration
- Added affiliate fields directly to the User model:
  - `paypal_email`: For affiliate payouts via PayPal
  - `referral_code`: Unique code for tracking referrals
  - `referred_by_user_id`: Foreign key to track who referred this user

### 2. Streamlined Affiliate Process
- Every user is now automatically an affiliate
- No separate status or opt-in required
- Eliminated the separate Affiliate table

### 3. Simplified Blueprint
- Created new `simplified_affiliate.py` blueprint
- Routes:
  - `/affiliate/dashboard` - View affiliate stats and earnings
  - `/affiliate/update_paypal_email` - Update PayPal email for payouts
  - `/affiliate/referral/<code>` - Track referrals from shared links

### 4. Template Updates
- Updated `tell_friend_tab.html` to work with User model directly
- Form action updated to use new route

### 5. Commission Processing
- Updated billing.py to reference User model directly
- No more status checks needed for affiliates
- Simplified referral tracking

## Migration Progress
- Successfully migrated affiliate data to User model
- Updated CustomerReferral and Commission models
- Updated app.py to register new simplified affiliate blueprint

## Technical Benefits

- Simplified queries by using User model directly
- Eliminated cross-model dependencies
- Fixed CSRF token validation issues in affiliate forms
- Made PayPal email updates more reliable

## Next Steps
