With a default 128 k context window and competitive throughput, it serves as a cost‑efficient workhorse for summarization, brainstorming and light code help. Internally, Arcee uses Blitz as the default writer in Conductor pipelines when the heavier Virtuoso line is not required. Users therefore get near‑70 B quality at ~⅓ the latency and price.

It incorporates a routing head that decides when (and how) to invoke a tool versus answering directly, reducing hallucinated calls. The model is already the backbone of Arcee Conductor's auto‑tool mode, where it parses user intent, emits clean function signatures and hands control back once the tool response is ready.

- Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches)
- Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.
- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs.

It incorporates techniques originally applied to larger GLM-Z1 models, including extended reinforcement learning, pairwise ranking alignment, and training on reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics, code, and logic. Despite its smaller size, it demonstrates strong performance on general-purpose reasoning tasks and outperforms many open-source models in its weight class.",32000,,,NO,,YES,YES,NO,,2025-05-07 21:34:51.563806,2025-05-24 16:58:57.431370,,,,No confident match found,,,NO
