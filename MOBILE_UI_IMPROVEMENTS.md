# Mobile UI Improvements

## Overview
This update transforms the mobile web interface for GloriaMundo Chat into a more app-like experience with better touch-friendly interactions and responsive design elements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Layout Structure
- **Fixed Header and Footer**: Only the chat content area scrolls, not the entire page
- **Proper Content Sizing**: Content areas automatically adjust to viewport height
- **No Overflow Issues**: Prevents the entire page from scrolling unnecessarily

### 2. Slide-in Sidebar
- **Hamburger Menu Toggle**: Touch-friendly access to sidebar content
- **Overlay Approach**: Sidebar slides over content rather than pushing it
- **Backdrop Effect**: Semi-transparent backdrop to indicate modal state
- **Full-Height Design**: Sidebar extends the full height of the viewport

### 3. Model Selection Interface
- **Numbered Buttons (1-6)**: Simple, touch-friendly selection of model presets
- **Dedicated Settings Button**: Arrow button for accessing advanced model selection
- **Bottom Sheet Panels**: Native app-like panel that slides up from the bottom
- **Two-Level Interface**:
  - First level shows preset buttons with currently selected model names
  - Second level shows filterable list of available models for the selected preset
- **Mobile-Optimized List**: Larger touch targets and clearer visual hierarchy

### 4. Touch-Friendly Controls
- **Larger Touch Targets**: All buttons and interactive elements sized appropriately for fingers
- **Centered Dropdowns**: Menus appear in the center of the screen rather than potentially off-screen
- **Responsive Transitions**: Smooth animations for state changes
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Active states and transitions provide clear user feedback

### 5. Technical Implementations
- **Global Function Exposure**: Core functions from script.js exposed globally for mobile.js
- **Custom Event System**: Events dispatched to coordinate between desktop and mobile interfaces
- **Mobile-First Detection**: Features activate based on viewport size
- **Coordinated State**: Mobile and desktop UIs stay in sync through shared state

## Testing
To test the mobile UI improvements:
1. Start the mobile test workflow: `python workflows/mobile_ui_test.py`
2. Open the application in a mobile browser or use responsive design mode in desktop browsers
3. Test all mobile-specific interactions: sidebar toggle, model selection, bottom sheets
