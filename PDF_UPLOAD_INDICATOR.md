# PDF Upload Visual Indicator Implementation

This document describes the changes made to implement visual indicators for PDF uploads in the chatbot interface.

## Overview
The PDF upload indicator feature provides clear visual feedback to users during the upload, processing, and successful loading of PDF documents. It addresses the previous issue where users had no visual indication when a PDF was successfully processed and ready for chat.

## Frontend Changes

### CSS Additions
- Added new CSS classes for the PDF upload indicator:
  - `.upload-indicator.pdf-upload` - Base styling for the indicator
  - `.upload-indicator.pdf-upload.success` - Green styling for successful uploads
  - `.upload-indicator.pdf-upload.error` - Red styling for failed uploads

### JavaScript Enhancements
- Enhanced `createUploadIndicator()` function to properly style the indicator
- Updated `handlePdfFile()` function to:
  - Show a spinning indicator during upload
  - Display a success message with document name upon completion
  - Show an error message with details if upload fails
  - Apply appropriate styling for each state
  - Include automatic fadeout after a delay

## Backend Changes

### API Response Enhancements
- Updated `upload_pdf()` to include `document_name` in the response
- Added the document name to both Azure storage and local storage response handlers
- This allows the frontend to display the actual document name in the success indicator

## Usage Flow
1. User selects a PDF file for upload
2. Blue processing indicator appears with spinner
3. Upon successful upload:
   - Indicator turns green with checkmark
   - Shows document name
   - Fades out after 3 seconds
4. If upload fails:
   - Indicator turns red with warning icon
   - Shows error message
   - Fades out after 5 seconds

## Testing
To test this feature:
1. Upload a PDF document to the chat
2. Verify the processing indicator appears during upload
3. Confirm the success message shows with the correct document name
4. Check that the indicator automatically disappears after a few seconds
