# Context Handling Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to fix application context issues and ensure proper handling of background threads.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **"Working outside of application context" errors**
   - Fixed by ensuring all Flask/SQLAlchemy operations have proper context
   - Created context-aware wrapper functions for scheduled jobs

2. **Slow application startup due to blocking model fetching**
   - Implemented non-blocking background threads for model data fetching
   - Added proper context handling in background threads

3. **RAG button functionality issues**
   - Fixed JavaScript model handling to maintain proper model capability data
   - Ensured proper synchronization between `allModels` and `loadedModels`

## Implementation Details

### 1. JavaScript Model Handling
- Added explicit global variables for model data structures
- Ensured `loadedModels` is always synchronized with `allModels`
- Added debugging logs for models with PDF support

### 2. Background Thread Improvements
- Created threads OUTSIDE of app context to prevent nesting
- Added a brief delay to prevent context collisions
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. Scheduler Context Wrapper
- Created a wrapper function that establishes proper app context
- Updated all scheduler calls to use the context-aware wrapper

### 4. Test Scripts
- Added app context testing scripts to validate fix patterns
- Created workflow for verifying context handling

## Best Practices

- **DO**: Create background threads OUTSIDE of any app context
- **DON'T**: Start threads within an existing app context
- **DO**: Use explicit context managers (`with app.app_context()`) in background threads
- **DON'T**: Access Flask/SQLAlchemy objects without context

## Testing

The improvements can be tested using:
```bash
python context_test_workflow.py
```

Successful output will show both the "anti-pattern" and "recommended pattern" executing, but the recommended pattern will have cleaner context transitions.

## Startup Performance

With these changes, application startup should be significantly improved as model fetching happens in the background without blocking the main thread.
