# PDF Filename Display Fix

## Issue Identified
The PDF filename was getting cut off in the document preview area, preventing users from seeing the full name of the uploaded PDF file. 

## Solution Applied
We made the following improvements to ensure full visibility of PDF filenames:

1. Added comprehensive CSS styling specifically for PDF filenames:
   - Set proper styling for the `.pdf-filename` element
   - Used `word-wrap: break-word` to allow text to wrap within the container
   - Improved background and padding to make the text more readable
   - Added proper spacing around the filename

2. Enhanced the PDF thumbnail styling:
   - Applied a flex layout to center and organize the PDF icon and filename
   - Added proper spacing between the icon and the filename
   - Set better sizing for the icon 

3. Ensured the container has the proper CSS class:
   - Added the `pdf-document` class to the container for consistent styling
   - This allows targeting PDF-specific styling in the CSS

## Result
- PDF filenames now display in full with proper text wrapping
- Improved readability with better background contrast
- Consistent styling with the rest of the document preview area
- Better visual hierarchy with proper spacing between elements

## Testing
- Verified that long PDF filenames now display correctly
- Confirmed that the styling works across different screen sizes
- Ensured that the PDF icon remains visible and properly sized
