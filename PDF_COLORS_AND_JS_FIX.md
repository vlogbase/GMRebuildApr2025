# PDF Colors and JavaScript Fixes

## Color Scheme Update

The PDF document visualization elements have been updated to use a muted green color scheme that better matches our application's UI:

1. Changed the PDF icon color from red (#e53e3e) to muted green (#4cd964)
2. Updated the PDF document container border and background colors to use matching green tones:
   - Border: rgba(76, 217, 100, 0.5)
   - Background: rgba(76, 217, 100, 0.1)

These changes provide a more cohesive visual experience that aligns with our existing color scheme.

## JavaScript Error Fix

Fixed the "Uncaught ReferenceError: fileUploadInput is not defined" error that was causing slower page loading:

1. Added proper initialization of the fileUploadInput variable by using document.getElementById('fileUpload')
2. Wrapped the event listener in a conditional check to ensure the element exists before trying to add an event listener

This fix resolves the JavaScript error and ensures the page loads properly and quickly.
