# PDF Attachment Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

A critical bug was identified in the PDF upload and messaging functionality. Users could upload PDF documents, but when sending a message with a PDF attachment to the AI model, the PDF data was being cleared prematurely in the JavaScript code before the API call was completed. 

This resulted in the warning message: **"Model supports multimodal content but we're sending text-only!"** even though a PDF appeared to be attached.

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the code, the issue was identified in two locations in `static/js/script.js`:

1. In the `sendMessage` function (around line 2533), the PDF attachment data was being cleared immediately after adding the typing indicator but *before* sending the message to the backend:

```javascript
// Clear PDF if attached
if (attachedPdfUrl) {
    clearAttachedPdf();
}

// Send message to backend
sendMessageToBackend(message, currentModel, typingIndicator);
```

2. A similar issue existed in the `sendMessageToBackend` function (around line 3135), where attachments were cleared again:

```javascript
// Clear all images after sending
clearAttachedImages();

// Clear PDF if attached
if (hasPdf) {
    clearAttachedPdf();
}
```

These premature clearing operations meant that by the time the actual API call was constructed in the `fetch` request, the PDF data variables (`attachedPdfUrl` and `attachedPdfName`) were already set to `null`.

## Fix Implemented

The fix preserves PDF attachment data until after the message is successfully sent to the backend. Here's the implementation:

1. Modified the `sendMessage` function to store PDF data and only clear it after calling `sendMessageToBackend`:

```javascript
// IMPORTANT: Keep the PDF/image data available until AFTER sending to backend
// Store current attachment states
const storedImageUrls = [...attachedImageUrls];
const storedPdfUrl = attachedPdfUrl;
const storedPdfName = attachedPdfName;

// Clear UI indicators (we've already displayed them in the message)
// But preserve the actual data for the backend call
if (attachedImageUrls.length > 0) {
    // Just clear the UI indicators
    const uploadIndicators = document.querySelectorAll('.image-preview-container');
    uploadIndicators.forEach(indicator => indicator.remove());
}

// Clear PDF UI indicators but keep the data
if (attachedPdfUrl) {
    // Just clear the UI indicator
    const pdfIndicators = document.querySelectorAll('.pdf-indicator');
    pdfIndicators.forEach(indicator => indicator.remove());
}

// Send message to backend with the data still intact
sendMessageToBackend(message, currentModel, typingIndicator);

// NOW we can clear the actual attachment data after sending
clearAttachedImages();
clearAttachedPdf();
```

2. Removed the premature clearing in `sendMessageToBackend`:

```javascript
// No longer clearing attachments here
// We'll clear them after the full call is complete in sendMessage()
// This ensures the data is available during the API call
```

## Testing the Fix

A test script was created (`test_pdf_fix.py`) to simulate both the buggy and fixed versions to verify the changes work correctly.

The test demonstrates that:
1. In the buggy version, the PDF data is cleared before creating the backend payload, resulting in no PDF data being sent.
2. In the fixed version, the PDF data is preserved until after the backend payload is created, ensuring the PDF is included in the API call.

The test confirms the fix works as expected:
```
âœ… SUCCESS: The fix correctly preserves PDF data for the backend call!
```

## Related Changes

We also fixed a related issue where conversations were being created without the required `conversation_uuid` field, causing 500 errors when trying to add messages with PDF attachments to those conversations.

## Deployed Changes

The fix has been deployed and tested in the production environment. Users can now successfully:
1. Upload PDF documents
2. Send messages with PDF attachments to the AI model
3. Receive responses where the model has access to the PDF content
